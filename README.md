Node js https://nodejs.org/en/download/

http-server https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server
`npm install http-server -g`

If you have node you can clone this and just install http-server (above).
Then you can `cd` into the dist folder and run `http-server`.
After running that it will give you a running server on your local machine.
Copy one of the returned addresses and paste in a browser. 

That's it!
